<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hair Transplant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT)</li><li>Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hair transplant market primarily comprises two techniques: Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). FUT involves removing a strip of scalp to extract hair follicles, which are then transplanted to thinning areas, often resulting in linear scarring.
