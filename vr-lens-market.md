<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VR Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Fresnel Lens</li><li>Fresnel Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The VR lens market encompasses two primary types: non-fresnel lenses and fresnel lenses. Non-fresnel lenses deliver high optical quality and a more immersive experience, often used in high-end VR headsets due to their clear image reproduction. In contrast, fresnel lenses are thinner and lighter, utilizing a series of concentric grooves to reduce weight while maintaining decent image clarity. This makes fresnel lenses popular in more accessible, compact VR devices where portability is key, balancing performance and affordability.</p></p>
