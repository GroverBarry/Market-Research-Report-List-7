<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atomic Magnetometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold atomic magnetometry</li><li>Spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cold atomic magnetometry utilizes ultra-cold atoms to achieve extremely high sensitivity in measuring magnetic fields. This technology is based on the quantum properties of atoms at very low temperatures. On the other hand, Spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometers operate at room temperature and use a specialized technique to eliminate the main source of noise in traditional magnetometers. They achieve high sensitivity by preventing the relaxation of atomic spins, allowing for precise magnetic field measurements in various applications.</p></p>
