<p><h1>Runtime Application Self-Protection Market Size, Market Trends, and Growth Outlook forecasted for period from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Runtime Application Self-Protection Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) is a security technology designed to protect applications from various threats in real-time while they are running. By integrating security directly into the application runtime environment, RASP can monitor and respond to attacks such as code injections, malware, and other vulnerabilities more effectively. As organizations increasingly depend on web and mobile applications, the demand for RASP solutions has surged, driven by the need for robust security measures amid rising cyberattacks.</p><p>The Runtime Application Self-Protection Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.5% during the forecast period. This growth is propelled by the continuous evolution of cyber threats and the increasing adoption of DevSecOps practices, which prioritize security in the software development lifecycle. Additionally, the rise of cloud-based applications and the Internet of Things (IoT) has heightened the need for real-time protection mechanisms. Key trends include the integration of RASP with other security technologies, such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, enhancing their effectiveness. Moreover, increased regulatory compliance requirements are driving organizations to adopt RASP solutions proactively, positioning this technology as a critical component in modern application security strategies.</p></p>
