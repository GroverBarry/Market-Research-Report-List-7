<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Leadless Pacemaker Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Chambered Systems</li><li>Double-Chambered Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Leadless pacemaker systems are innovative cardiac devices that lack traditional leads, reducing the risk of complications. Single-chambered systems are designed to stimulate either the right atrium or the right ventricle, ideal for patients with simple pacing needs. In contrast, double-chambered systems engage both the atrium and ventricle, offering more comprehensive regulation of heart rhythm, particularly for those with complex arrhythmias. Both types enhance patient comfort and recovery while minimizing infection risks and improving overall efficacy in cardiac management.</p></p>
