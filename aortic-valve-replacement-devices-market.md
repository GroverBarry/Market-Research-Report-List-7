<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aortic Valve Replacement Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Surgery</li><li>Minimally Invasive Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aortic Valve Replacement Devices Market includes two main types of procedures: Open Surgery and Minimally Invasive Surgery. Open surgery involves a traditional approach where the chest is opened to access the heart and replace the valve. In contrast, minimally invasive surgery is a less invasive procedure that involves smaller incisions and specialized tools to replace the valve. Both methods have their own set of advantages and risks, and the choice between them depends on the patient's specific condition and preferences.</p></p>
