<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Surface Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The road surface sensor market is categorized into active and passive types. Active sensors actively emit signals, such as infrared or ultrasonic waves, to measure road conditions, temperature, and surface distress. These sensors require power and often provide real-time data. In contrast, passive sensors do not emit signals but instead rely on external sources, such as traffic flow or environmental conditions, to gather data. They are generally energy-efficient and easier to install, making them suitable for various monitoring applications.</p></p>
