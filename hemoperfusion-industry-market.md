<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hemoperfusion Industry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Charcoal Hemoperfusion</li><li>Certain Resins Hemoperfusion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hemoperfusion industry is primarily segmented into two market types: charcoal hemoperfusion and certain resins hemoperfusion. Charcoal hemoperfusion utilizes activated charcoal to effectively adsorb toxins and drugs from the blood, making it widely used in treating drug overdoses and certain poisonings. In contrast, certain resins hemoperfusion employs specialized resins that target specific substances in the bloodstream, enabling more selective removal of unwanted compounds. Both methods aim to enhance patient care by improving toxin clearance and overall clinical outcomes.</p></p>
