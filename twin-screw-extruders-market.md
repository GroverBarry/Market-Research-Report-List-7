<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Twin-screw Extruders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Co-Rotating</li><li>Counter Rotating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Twin-screw extruders are categorized into two types based on the direction of the screws – co-rotating and counter-rotating. In co-rotating extruders, the screws rotate in the same direction, aiding in efficient mixing and conveying of materials. On the other hand, in counter-rotating extruders, the screws rotate in opposite directions, providing more intense mixing and higher shear forces. Each type has its own advantages and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the extrusion process.</p></p>
